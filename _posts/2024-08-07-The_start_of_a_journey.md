The journey towards achieving the OSCP certification is a challenging and rewarding endeavor, one that I am excited to embark upon. It all begins with a solid foundation, and for me, that foundation is the PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester) certification. The PNPT will serve as the starting point of my study sessions, providing me with the essential skills and knowledge necessary to excel in penetration testing.

The roadmap for my journey will look like this: **PJOR to PNPT to OSCP**.

With the PJOR (Pentester Junior Offensive Researcher) as the initial stepping stone, I will build the necessary basics and then move on to the PNPT certification as my first major milestone. This initial phase will equip me with practical, hands-on experience in areas such as network mapping, vulnerability identification, and exploitation techniques. By mastering these core skills, I will be well-prepared to tackle the more advanced challenges that lie ahead.

As I progress, my studies will become increasingly focused on the specific requirements of the OSCP certification. I will immerse myself in the world of ethical hacking, dedicating countless hours to understanding and practicing the intricate details of system security. This will include mastering topics such as buffer overflows, web application vulnerabilities, and privilege escalation techniques.

Throughout this journey, I will be guided by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and an unwavering commitment to excellence. The road to OSCP is demanding, but it is also incredibly fulfilling. Each step taken, each challenge overcome, will bring me closer to my ultimate goal of becoming an OSCP-certified professional.

Stay tuned as I document my progress, share insights, and reflect on the lessons learned along the way. This is not just a journey towards certification; it is a journey towards mastery and a deeper understanding of cybersecurity.
